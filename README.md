# 📱 MAST5112 — Mobile App Scripting

*React Native Development — Class Notes & Reference Material*

Welcome to the official repository for **Mobile App Scripting (MAST5112)**. This repository is maintained to support students by providing practical guides, notes, and reference material that mirrors the work covered in class. It supplements the official manual and LMS resources by offering a clear and structured walk-through of coding practices, project setup, and important concepts in React Native.

## 🎓 Course Purpose

MAST5112 introduces students to **mobile application development** using the **React Native framework** with TypeScript. Throughout this module, students will:

* Learn how to build cross-platform apps for Android (and optionally iOS)
* Use component-based design principles
* Apply state management and event handling
* Develop working prototypes for real-world scenarios

We develop and test apps in a **Virtual Machine (VM)** environment that comes preconfigured with all the required software (VS Code, Node.js, Expo, Android Studio, and BlueStacks).

## 🧠 Important Student Responsibilities

* ✅ **Visit this repository regularly.** All updated or newly added notes, code examples, and project requirements will be stored here.
* ✅ **Work in your group project folders** Each group must maintain a separate repo containing their source code, assets, and development notes.
* ✅ **Push your code to GitHub frequently.** This serves as your version control and submission log.
* ✅ **Submit final deliverables via the LMS (Arc / Brightspace).** GitHub is for code and progress tracking, but official submissions (presentations, evaluations, reports) must be uploaded to the LMS as instructed.
* ✅ **Update your group project `README.md`.** Summarize what the project does, decisions made, progress updates, and reflections for external reviewers and teammates.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

* **React Native** (with Expo)
* **TypeScript**
* **Visual Studio Code**
* **BlueStacks / Android Studio Emulator**
* **GitHub for version control**
* **Virtual Machine Environment** (configured in labs)

## 📧 Support

If you have any questions or encounter issues with the content or your development environment:

* First, consult the documentation in the `docs/` folder
* Then, review any notes and announcements posted on the LMS
* If still unresolved, raise the issue during class time or reach out via your designated group communication channels
