# 📘 **README Development Guide**

## For Mobile App Scripting (MAST5112) – Chef App Project

This guide will help you develop a complete and well-structured `README.md` file for your project repository.

⚠️ **Important:**
This is **not** a template to copy and paste. Each section is explained so you can write your own content. Think of this README as your **project portfolio**, useful for **grading**, but also for **your future development career**.

---

## 1. 💡 Basic Information

### What to Include:

* App title
* Your full name and student number
* Course and subject title
* Links:

  * GitHub repository
  * YouTube video walkthrough of your app

### Why This Matters:

This section gives the reader (lecturer, moderator, or future recruiter) a clear **snapshot of your project**: who built it, for what purpose, and where to find it online. This is standard in both academia and industry documentation.

---

## 2. 🧭 Project Overview

### What to Include:

* A high-level summary of what your app does
* Brief background on the purpose of the project
* Mention that the app was created using **React Native + TypeScript** via **Expo**

### Why This Matters:

Readers need a **quick understanding** of what the app is. This section is your app’s elevator pitch — a few sentences that clearly explain the app’s concept without needing to open the code.

---

## 3. 🎯 Purpose & Features

### What to Include:

**Purpose:**

* Explain what problem the app solves and for whom (e.g., a private chef managing menus)

**Key Features:**
List and describe your main app features. Examples:

* View prepared menu
* Add, edit, or delete menu items
* View average price per course
* Search functionality
* Role-specific access (Chef vs. Client)

If features were introduced in Part 2 or Part 3, clearly indicate that.

### Why This Matters:

Anyone reading your project needs to know **what functionality has been implemented**. This shows both your technical understanding and your ability to connect features with user needs — which is valuable in real development environments.

---

## 4. 🖌️ Design Overview (From Part 1)

### What to Include:

* Screenshots or exports of your **original UI designs** (e.g., from Figma or Canva)
* Explain each screen:

  * Its purpose
  * The components it includes
  * Which user interacts with it (Chef or Client)
* Clearly show how your design evolved into your final screens

### Why This Matters:

This demonstrates that you:

* Planned your app thoroughly
* Can connect design to implementation
* Understand **user experience (UX)**

This section also supports your work from **Part 1** and helps communicate your thought process.

---

## 5. 🧩 Navigation & Flow

### What to Include:

* A written description of how a user moves between screens
* A **flowchart or diagram** showing the navigation paths
* List the **navigation dependencies** you used:

  * e.g., `@react-navigation/native`, `@react-navigation/native-stack`

### Why This Matters:

This shows you understand **app structure** and **navigation logic** — a core part of building modern mobile apps. It also prepares you for more complex implementations involving authentication or role-based access in Part 3.

---

## 6. 🔧 Technologies & Dependencies

### What to Include:

* React Native + TypeScript (via Expo)
* All key libraries and dependencies, such as:

  * `@react-navigation/native`
  * `@react-navigation/native-stack`
  * `@react-native-picker/picker`
  * `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
  * `react-native-safe-area-context`
  * `react-native-screens`
  * Any icon libraries or custom fonts (e.g., `expo-google-fonts`)
* Mention any dev tools or plugins used (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, Figma)

### Why This Matters:

You are documenting your **tech stack** — which is a standard expectation in software development. This helps other developers (or your lecturers) understand how your app was built and what it relies on.

---

## 7. 🧱 File/Folder Structure

### What to Include:

A brief description (or visual overview) of your project structure. Example:

```
App.tsx
/src
  /components
  /screens
  /data
  /types
  /navigation
```

You can also explain what each folder is used for.

### Why This Matters:

Good developers write organized code and know how to explain their structure to others. This is also helpful for **collaboration**, version control, and debugging.

---

## 8. 📷 Screenshots & Video Demonstration

### What to Include:

* Screenshots of key screens (at least 2–3)
* Captions explaining what each screen shows
* Link to your YouTube walkthrough

> 🎙️ In your video, narrate your choices: what you’ve built, why, and how it works. Mention your challenges and learning as well.

### Why This Matters:

Visual and spoken communication makes your project more understandable and professional. It helps the markers **see your work in action**, which is especially helpful if code is incomplete or if features were partially implemented.

---

## 9. 🪛 Development Process & CHANGELOG

### What to Include:

* A running **changelog** showing:

  * Dates
  * New features added
  * Fixes and changes made
  * Deleted features (if any)
* Reflect on **what was changed and why** across development phases (Part 1 → Part 2 → Part 3)

### Why This Matters:

This is part of real-world documentation. A good changelog shows:

* How your thinking evolved
* What you’ve done week to week
* That you’re learning from the process and improving your work

Use the **Changelog Guide** to structure this section.

---

## 10. 🧠 Challenges, Learnings & Reflections

### What to Include:

Reflect honestly:

* What was hard to implement?
* What did you struggle to understand?
* What would you do differently next time?
* How did you overcome challenges (e.g., search bugs, picker issues, screen layout)?

### Why This Matters:

This is important both **academically** and **professionally**. It shows critical thinking and a growth mindset. Employers, interviewers, and lecturers all value developers who can reflect and improve.

---

## 11. 📚 References

### What to Include:

* Any tutorials, videos, or guides you used
* Icons, font sources, and design inspiration
* Code you adapted (with attribution)
* Academic sources, if required

Follow your institution’s required reference format.

### Why This Matters:

Citing your sources is part of academic integrity. In development, it also shows that you can learn from others — a valuable skill in team projects.

---

## 12. 📸 List of Figures (Optional but Encouraged)

### What to Include:

* A table or list of all screenshots and visuals used
* Labels and brief descriptions for each

### Why This Matters:

This improves the readability of your document. It also helps lecturers or moderators quickly locate visuals, especially when cross-checking features.

---

## 13. 🤖 Disclosure of AI Usage (If Applicable)

### What to Include:

If you used tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or any AI assistant:

* What sections it was used for
* What tools were used
* Why and how they helped
* Dates and (optional) screenshots or links

### Why This Matters:

Academic honesty is essential. Disclosing use of AI also helps **your lecturers understand your work** and **where support was needed**. It does not count against you, but hiding it might.

---

## 🧠 Final Advice

* A great README is **as important** as your code.
* It shows that you’re organized, thoughtful, and serious about your work.
* This document is a portfolio piece — it can be shown to future employers, internship supervisors, or collaborators.
* Write it clearly, review it, and make sure it's readable even by someone who never saw your code before.
